        <ul>
            <li>Consists of 5 players, with 5 unique roles.</li>
            <li>Roles: King, Queen, Knight, Princess, The Royal Fool.</li>
            <li>Each role has specific win conditions. Nobody is particularly aligned with anybody else. Everyone simply aims to achieve their own win condition by voting for who dies.</li>
            <li>The game lasts for one day one night. A player is voted to be hanged during the day. At night another player is executed.</li>
            <li>A winner is decided on the second day by seeing which win condition applies to the scenario observed.</li>

        <h3>Roles and win conditions</h3>
        <h4>Authority figures</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>King</strong>: A mildly oblivious ruler who realizes that the Fool, Knight and Queen are out to corrupt the monarchy. He therefore calls everyone closely tied to the affairs of the Palace to his Chambers.
            <ul>
                <li>Has knowledge of the identity of the Princess.</li>
                <li>The king aims to win by killing the Fool, and either the Knight or Queen.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Queen</strong>: A manipulative Queen who controls the affairs of the Kingdom through the puppet King. She collaborates with her followers and manipulates the Fool to overthrow the King.
            <ul>
                <li>Has knowledge of the identity of the Knight.</li>
                <li>The Queen aims to win by killing the King, and either the Princess or the Fool.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Servants to the Monarchy</h4>
        <p>

            <strong>Knight</strong>: A haughty Knight aiming to achieve high status by backstabbing his way to the top and serving the King.
            <ul>
                <li>Has knowledge of the identity of the King.</li>
                <li>The Knight aims to win by killing the Princess, and either the Queen or Fool.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Princess</strong>: A rebellious princess who only aims to displease her father by marrying an incompetent suitor.
            <ul>
                <li>Has knowledge of the identity of the Fool.</li>
                <li>The Princess aims to win by killing the Queen, and either the Knight or the King.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Fool</strong>: A simple jester who aims to either marry the Princess or Queen to escape poverty, or to achieve high status in the Kingdom. The King is extremely opposed to these goals.
            <ul>
                <li>Has knowledge of the identity of the Queen</li>
                <li>The Fool aims to win by killing the Knight, and either the King or Princess.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Golden Rule of execution: The first execution is decided with a public vote among the members.
            <br /> A majority of 3 is required to decide the execution. The second execution is decided in private by the 4 remaining. The player who received the majority of votes is then executed and a winner is decided. In event of a tie, the tie-breaking
            weight is awarded to predetermined player. Various players receive the vote, depending on the player executed previously.
