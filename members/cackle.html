    Hello my name is WitchDoctorCackle and I founded the sisterhood. Some of you may know me as "Animallover77" which is my form when my magic meter deplenishes and i must revert back to #regular.  The reason we created this wonderful community was to show that we care about all our fellow mafia members. Some ask '"why witchdoctor' and I say to them why not. Now I hope you will join us &lt;3</p>
