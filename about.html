  <p>
    You will find the sisterhood congregated at the bottom of the userlist in the mafia room, sharing their latest findings of the great spells passed on from Ye Five Old Witches of the past.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will gladly share our magic with anyone who wishes to join our order of Witch Doctors.
    Some of our rituals and spells include:
    <ul>
      <li>@y - a spell that enters you into a mafia game.  This enchantment creates friendship between the players, melting away any animosity from previous games. This spell was invented to allow all Witches great and small cast a magic circle and join the game.</li>
      <li>/me cackle - A ritual passed down by one of Ye Five Old Witches, WitchDoctorCackle. This ritual is used to call forth the spirits of unity and fill the players with a sense of community.</li>
      <li>witchdoctorsignup - A summoning spell of the highest difficulty invented by WitchDoctorHawkie.  This spell has been passed down through the generations to allow the sisterhood to call for one another.  It's magic draws many witches together.</li>
    </ul>

  <div style="text-align: center"><h1>Our History</h1></div>
  <p>
    The sisterhood was found by Ye Five Olde Witches - WitchDoctorKek, WitchDoctorMoan, WitchDoctorPower, WitchDoctorAlt, Witchdoctorcackle - the great five who founded the guild of witch doctors. On the fateful day when the witch doctors were playing a CS by the Great Sage Java, Sister Cackle recruited Sister Kek into her cult, and ended up winning by turboing all the non witches.  The wizard TWD came on and casted a powerful curse on Ye Five Olde Witches, preventing their magic from working in any more Mafia games for a day.  Since that day, the Sisterhood has proudly upheld the name of the Witch Doctor, and proudly wears their title when conjuring up spells for Mafia games.

  <div style="text-align: center"><h1>Our Vision</h1></div>
  <p>
    We are a group of mafia players that believe in having fun in games.  We believe in serious competitive play, and will not fall to uncompetitive standards, such as lynching based on name.
  </p>
  <p>
    We vow to treat all users who respect us, with polite courtesy, whether or not they are a witch doctor.
